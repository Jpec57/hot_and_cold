# Flutter starter

This is a starter for any Flutter project.


## Set up

- Check dependencies (Some basic dependencies have been chosen for you. Each dependency's use is specified, feel free to comment/remove those you won't use.)
- Rename the project's name (in `pubspec.yaml`)
- Change package name in android and ios
- Change `BASE_REMOTE_URL` in `rest.dart`



## A few commands to get started

### Icon

Run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` to generate your launch icon

### JSON Serialization

Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` after a change in the `models` directory.
